# PhishGuard-Simple-Phishing-Detector
Client-side phishing URL analyzer with heuristics, lookalike detection, UX polish, and local scan history, no backend required.

PhishGuard — Simple Phishing Detector
A lightweight, responsive web app (single index.html) that analyzes URLs for common phishing indicators perfect for beginners who want a practical security project to demo in their portfolio.
